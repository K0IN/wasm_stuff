# WASM Collection

## What is this?

This is a collection of some WebAssembly experiments I did, 
its meant to teach others, not to do high level code.

## Requirements

> Make

> Clang 9 or above

> A Webserver [you can find a webserver here (py3)](server4.py)

> npm

## What we got

What|Description
--------|-----------
[Simple call async JS from C](/async_call_from_c/README.md) | using async `JS` functions from `C`
[Simple multithreading](/multithreading/README.md) | starting a `C` function from `C` in a other thread

## QA

todo

## Other info

I used clang 10 for every experiment if you use a other version you might need to change the clang version in the Makefiles

Also feel free to contribute your own findings ;)
